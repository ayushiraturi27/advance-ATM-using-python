🧾 ATM Program (Basic Version)

# Simple ATM Program

print("====== Welcome to Python ATM ======")

# Initial balance
balance = 5000  

# Step 1: Ask user for PIN
pin = int(input("Enter your 4-digit PIN: "))

# Step 2: Check if PIN is correct
if pin == 1234:
    print("\nLogin successful!")
    print("1. Check Balance")
    print("2. Deposit Money")
    print("3. Withdraw Money")
    print("4. Exit")

    # Step 3: Ask for user choice
    choice = int(input("\nEnter your choice (1-4): "))

    # Step 4: Use if-else to perform actions
    if choice == 1:
        print(f"\nYour current balance is ₹{balance}")

    elif choice == 2:
        deposit = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: ₹"))
        balance += deposit
        print(f"\n₹{deposit} deposited successfully.")
        print(f"Updated balance: ₹{balance}")

    elif choice == 3:
        withdraw = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: ₹"))
        if withdraw <= balance:
            balance -= withdraw
            print(f"\n₹{withdraw} withdrawn successfully.")
            print(f"Remaining balance: ₹{balance}")
        else:
            print("\nInsufficient balance!")

    elif choice == 4:
        print("\nThank you for using Python ATM 😊")

    else:
        print("\nInvalid choice! Please try again.")

else:
    print("\nIncorrect PIN! Please try again.")

💡 How it works

1. Asks for a PIN (use 1234 to log in).


2. Shows a menu (Check Balance / Deposit / Withdraw / Exit).


3. Performs actions using simple if-elif-else logic.


4. Updates and shows the balance.
